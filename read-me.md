If you're getting this error you'll need to do the following. I've updated this guide to reflect changes the Google website.

1. Head over to the Google Developer Console

2. Click "create" to create a new project (you'll need to create or sign in to a Google account).

3. On the "New Project" screen, click "create" to create the project with the default name.

4. Visit "library" in the sidebar. (screenshot)

5. Search for "Geocoding API" and select it.

6. On the Geocoding API page, click "enable" and wait for the API to be enable. This can fail. If it does, just click "enable" a second time.

7. This will bring you over to the library dashboard page. Select the credentials tab near the top of the page.

8. You should see two autogenerated keys listed. Copy the key value for the "Server key" to the clipboard.

9. Change the request URL by adding a "key" query string. That would be something like the following. Note I've added "&" to separate the key value pairs. The new key value pair is "key" for the key and the API Key from Google for the value.

10. The request should work without any errors.
